TinyDX V1.0, a miniature high-frequency (HF) digital modes transceiver optimized for FT8 and FT4 operation. Developed with an emphasis on extreme portability and USB power efficiency, TinyDX integrates a 

full-featured two-band transceiver within a 50 mm × 25 mm × 30 mm enclosure. The system achieves sub-watt transmission power, low current draw, and complete operation from standard 5V USB sources, 

eliminating the need for separate power supplies or computers in field operation.
